Web service for users to create text-based forums that support posts, comments, and messaging - think of it as a simplified, text-only, version of reddit.

Currently the backend is built using standard Java - I eventually plan to rebuild this backend using Java Spring MVC. RESTAPI's have been tested and are working correctly. There is a browser-based front-end in this but it is very low quality and was meant to verify the functionality of the backend. I am in the process of building the actual User-Friendly frontend, as well as deploying the backend on AWS for viewing.
